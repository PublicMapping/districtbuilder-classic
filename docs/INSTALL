The Public Mapping Project
https://github.com/PublicMapping/

== Prerequisites ==

This software requires a few other pieces of free software to run.  Before 
you can run the public mapping web site, you'll need to install and 
configure:

Apache v 2.2
Geoserver v 2.0.2
Postgresql v 9.1 w/ PostGIS
Python v 2.7
Django v 1.4

On a debian-based system with aptitude installed, you can install most of
the necessary software using the command:

> sudo aptitude install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev \
    python-django python-lxml python-gdal python-rpy2 python-scipy \
    python-psycopg2 python-setuptools postgresql-9.1-postgis \
    tomcat6 tomcat6-admin gettext redis-server

For python libraries that aren't in the ubuntu repositories, you can
use pip (a replacement for easy_install) to get secondary python libraries,
mostly used for background processes:

> sudo easy_install pip

== Additional Packages==

In order to allow recovery of passwords, a mail server is recommended. An
external mail service provider is recommended, as securing a local mailserver
against spam is a task best suited to a security expert. If required, the
application can use a locally running mailserver. 

It is often beneficial to keep your system up to date with security 
patches. Many standard Linux distributions provide a facility for automatic
updates, and is not covered in this README.

    NOTE: It is possible that automatic updates may break the DistrictBuilder
    software if a dependency changes, or if one of the underlying components
    are upgraded while the application is running. This may result in downtime
    or loss of data. Use automatic security updates at your own risk.

Running inst_extra.sh will install and configure mail, automatic security 
update support, and install tmpreaper (for cleaning generated files such
as reports and downloads) and cron jobs. 

== Installation ==

 1. Check out the public mapping projects to the /projects directory of 
    your linux installation.

    > sudo mkdir -p /projects/PublicMapping
    > cd /projects/PublicMapping

    You can download the PublicMapping source from the website or use git
    to grab the code
        
      
     a. If you do not have git installed use:

        > sudo apt-get install git

	You can grab the source code from github via the read-only
	link if you're not going to contribute code back.
	
	> git clone git://github.com/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder.git
	> cd DistrictBuilder

	Install additional python library requirements.

        > sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

	You may want to switch to a stable tag rather than using the master 
	branch.  You can see all the availale tags with.

	> git tag -l

	This example switches to v2.0.
	
	> git checkout v2.0

     b. If you want to contribute to the project, you should fork the github
	repository and clone your fork.  You can offer pull requests with
	your improvements

     c. If you don't have git installed, download the project and 
        expand it into /projects/PublicMapping.  Change the name of the
	downloaded folder to DistrictBuilder to be consistent with the
	rest of this README
    
 2. Create a "local" directory - this is where your machine-specific settings,
    reports, and data will go:

    > sudo mkdir -p /projects/PublicMapping/local/reports
    > sudo chown www-data:www-data /projects/PublicMapping/local/reports

 3. Allow write access by the web user to the locale message files,
    if you are supporting more than one language. For each language,
    run:

    > sudo chown www-data:www-data /projects/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder/django/publicmapping/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/*o

    Substitute "en" above for the language code that you will support.

 4. At this point, make sure that you have postgres and postgis 
    installed.

    You may need to run the postgis install script if you don't have a 
    postgis template db. Check the postgis site for installation 
    instructions if you're not familiar with postgis:

       http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ch02.html

    Note that the aptitude install above will not generate templates. To 
    generate templates:

    > sudo su postgres 
    > createdb -E UTF8 -T template0 -l en_US.UTF-8 template_postgis
    > psql -d template_postgis -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql
    > psql -d template_postgis -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql 
    > exit

 5. Once postgis is intalled, run the PublicMapping_db.sql script in 
    the sql directory:

    > sudo -u postgres psql -f /projects/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder/sql/publicmapping_db.sql

    This will create a publicmapping db from the template_postgis 
    template, along with a publicmapping user role.  The publicmapping 
    user will be assigned all permissions and ownership on the db.

 6. Make sure your pg_hba file in your postgres configuration allows 
    password-based authentication on the local machine:

    http://developer.postgresql.org/pgdocs/postgres/auth-pg-hba-conf.html

    You will need a row that looks like this in your pg_hba file:
    
        local   all   all   md5

    Put that above the line that reads "local all all ident" so that 
    password authentication is allowed before user ident authentication
     
 7. Download the datafile to /projects/PublicMapping/data, and unzip into
    the import directory: /data/:

    > sudo mkdir /projects/PublicMapping/data
    > cd /projects/PublicMapping/data
    > sudo wget --no-check-certificate -O VA_data.zip \
          https://s3.amazonaws.com/districtbuilderdata/VA_data.zip
    > sudo mkdir /data
    > cd /data
    > sudo unzip /projects/PublicMapping/data/VA_data.zip

    *Note* that if you are loading spatial data for a coverage other than
    the demonstration coverage over Virginia, you will need to ensure that the 
    spatial reference of the data is "Web Auxiliary Sphere" or "Popular 
    Visualisation CRS / Mercator". The definition for all GIS software 
    packages is available here:
        
    http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3785/

 8. Run the setup script with the appropriate parameters - the parts of 
    the app you want to set up, along with the path to an xsd and a 
    config.xml file.  
    
     a. To get a mostly-configured configuration, copy the distribution
        configuration to get started.

        > cd /projects/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder/docs/
        > sudo cp config.dist.xml config.xml

        Adjust the database connection parameters and server information
        in the distribution configuration. Many of the other settings
        should be good enough to start with.

     b. To set up the application database, import the spatial
        data, configure geoserver, and create BARD data files (if
        necessary), run:

        > sudo ./setup.py ../../docs/config.xsd ../../docs/config.xml

     c. To configure portions of the application seperately, get more help 
        on the setup tool by typing:

        > ./setup.py --help

    For any of the following steps, you may also include -vX for verbose
    output during the setup process. This may be handy in identifying 
    problems during the setup process.

    If you run each setup step seperately, they must be performed in the
    following order (all steps are required to get a properly functioning 
    application):

    > -d  : Create the database schema. This must happen before any other 
            step of the setup process, and can be performed multiple times 
            if the configuration matches the database settings with no side
            effects.
    > -g0 : Import the first (0 based index) GeoLevel from the configuration
            file.
    > -gX : Import the Xth* (0 based index) GeoLevel from the configuration 
            file.
    > -nX : Renest the geometry and data values from the Xth* (0 based 
            index) GeoLevel.
    > -V  : Create database views for the spatial layers in Geoserver.
    > -G  : Configure a running Geoserver with the loaded spatial data.
            **Note** Running this flag requires a configured and running
            Geoserver.
    > -b  : Compute and store a BARD basemap for BARD reports.
    > -t  : Create the template plans that are configured. This step may 
            happen any time after the nesting step.
    > -s  : Collect all the static files used by the web application into
            a location served by apache for performance.

    * The importing and nesting must occur in the order of smallest 
    geography to largest geography.

 9. Django serves up SLD files to clients, and need this mime type added
    to the system's known mime types in order to serve the content
    properly.

    a. Open the file /etc/mime.types in your favorite editor.
    b. Find the line that starts with "application/xml"
    c. Add " sld" to the end of this line, after "xml xsl xsd"

10. Now that you have the app configured and your data imported, you can 
    run the app using Django's testing server
     
    > python ./manage.py runserver

11. You will see a notice that your server is running and you can access 
    your application at 127.0.0.1:8000  Enter that location into your 
    browser on the local machine and you should be able to use the 
    application.

== Apache Configuration ==

 1. Running the application from the django development server is good for
    setup, but for a production environment, you will want to configure
    Apache.  First, copy the apache file into the "sites-available" 
    Apache config directory (typically /etc/apache2/sites-available/)

    > cp /projects/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder/django/publicmapping.apache \
        /etc/apache2/sites-available/publicmapping

 2. Enable the new publicmapping site in apache

    > a2ensite publicmapping

 3. If you are NOT running the public mapping project as the default
    web site in Apache, you will have to edit publicmapping.apache to
    reflect your configuration (e.g. VirtualHost directives).

 4. If you ARE running the public mapping project as the default web
    site in Apache, remove the default site configuration:

   > a2dissite default

 5. Make sure you have the following modules for apache enabled: proxy, 
    proxy_http, rewrite, wsgi and ssl
    
   > a2enmod proxy proxy_http rewrite wsgi ssl

 6. You may need to update /etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf  
    If you see:

        Deny from All

    change it to

        Allow from All

 7. An update to the wsgi module requires a change to the publicmapping
    apache configuration file. If your version of wsgi is >= 3, ensure
    that line 121 is commented out, and line 130 is uncommented.

    If your version of wsgi is < 3, ensure that line 121 is uncommented, 
    and line 130 is commented out.

 8. This application requires SSL. You will need to generate your
    own publicmapping certficate and key and place them in the 
    /etc/ssl/certs directory with the names publicmapping.crt and 
    publicmapping.key.

    If you have trusted certificates created (or you prefer different 
    names), you can edit the location of the files in the publicmapping 
    apache file.

    Generating SSL certificates is beyond the scope of this README.  Check
    the Apache web site for more info:

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/ssl_faq.html

 9. This application runs as the apache user, usually www-data.  Be sure 
    the file permissions allow for the www-data to read the project 
    directories.  Only the reports directory needs to be writable by 
    www-data.  No files are required to be readable by "all".

      sudo mkdir /projects/PublicMapping/local/reports
      sudo chgrp -R www-data /projects/PublicMapping/
      sudo chmod -R 750 /projects/PublicMapping/
      sudo chmod 770 /projects/PublicMapping/local/reports
   

== Geoserver configuration ==

    Geoserver installation is **required** to complete the installation
    with the setup.py script. Complete these setup steps before running
    step 8 in the Installation steps above. It's possible to run sections
    of the setup script without geoserver installed, but geoserver is 
    required for the -G setup section.
  
 1. To install geoserver, first make sure Tomcat is installed and running
    properly; that means you can get to http://yourComputerName:8080/ and 
    see the "It works" page. You will also need to set up a tomcat user 
    that can manage and administer your site.  You can edit the 
    /var/lib/tomcat6/conf/tomcat-users.xml file to create this user.

 2. Download Geoserver in WAR (Web Archive) format from:
 
        http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+2.0.2

 3. Unzip the downloaded zip file so you can access the geoserver.war file.

 4. Copy the .war file to the tomcat webapps dir.  It should be unpacked
    automatically and deployed at the default /geoserver context
    
    > sudo cp geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/
    > sudo service tomcat6 restart
    
 5. Add the REST Extension to GeoServer.

     a. Change to the WEB-INF/lib directory inside of the GeoServer webapp,
        inside of tomcat. This folder may be:

        > cd /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib

     b. Download the GeoServer REST Extension that matches your installed
        version of GeoServer. 

        > sudo wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/geoserver/GeoServer%20Extensions/2.0.2/geoserver-2.0.2-restconfig-plugin.zip

     c. Extract this plugin in the current folder (lib):

        > sudo unzip geoserver-2.0.2-restconfig-plugin.zip
        > sudo chown tomcat6:tomcat6 restconfig*

     d. Restart tomcat to pick up the changes to the geoserver application:
     
        > sudo service tomcat6 restart

 6. Set the geowebcache directory to a non-default.  Otherwise your tiles 
    will be saved to /tmp and possibly disappear on reboot.  Add the 
    following snippet to your <web-app> configuration in geoserver's webapp
    configuration:
    
    > cd /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF
    > sudo nano web.xml    

      <!-- Change the geowebcache dir -->
      <context-param>
        <param-name>GEOWEBCACHE_CACHE_DIR</param-name>
        <param-value>/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/geoserver/data/gwc</param-value>
      </context-param>

 7. Now that your GeoServer is configured, you should use the Services > 
    GWC link in the menu to seed some of your layers.  This will make the 
    base map layers appear faster.

== BARD / Reports Configuration ==
    DistrictBuilder can create reports using one of two backends.  If you'd
    like to use the ScoreFunctions written into DistrictBuilder, please see 
    the documentation on reporting configuration in the DistrictBuilder wiki.
    If you'd like to use reports created by BARD - a statistical package
    written in R - you'll need to follow the directions below to install BARD
    and its dependencies.

 1. In order to use the BARD Reporting features, you will need to 
    install BARD and R2HTML as the root user so that it's accessible to 
    the django process.  Installing the geos dev libraries is needed to
    install the rgeos package.
    
    > sudo aptitude install r-base-dev build-essential libgeos-dev 
    > sudo R CMD javareconf
    > sudo R
    >> install.packages('R2HTML', dependencies=TRUE)
    >> install.packages('stringr', dependencies=TRUE)
    >> install.packages('ineq', dependencies=TRUE)
    >> install.packages('rgeos', repos='http://R-Forge.R-project.org', dependencies=TRUE)
    >> install.packages('BARD', dependencies=TRUE)
    >> q('no')

    If you have trouble installing any of these packages, you may need to 
    hunt down and install a dependency or two, depending on your linux 
    distribution.  NB: R packages are installed from source so you'll need
    the build-essential package to install BARD.

 2. By default, reports are served from the following directory:

    /projects/PublicMapping/local/reports

 3. You can also install the "reporting" app onto another server so that 
    your web server is separated from your reporting server. If you decide
    to do so, you can set the BARD_SERVER variable in your BardConfig in 
    the xml file.  Use a fully qualified domain name, e.g. 
    http://reporting.server.com

 SECURITY NOTES:
    No server authentication is required to run or read a report.
    The only "protection" on viewing a created report is a simple hash in the URL.
    Because the reports are not protected by a password, consider any reports
    run on the app to be viewable to the public. It is possible for users to
    share these URLs with non-users of the system.

    When configuring the reporting server on a machine other than the
    DistrictBuilder server, be sure to allow the reports server to accept 
    requests only from the DistrictBuilder server.  This will prevent non-users
    from requesting report creation.

== Celery Configuration ==
    Some processes take too long to happen over a synchronous web 
    connection. The app uses a process queue called celery to make
    these actions happen in the background so the web application 
    stays performant.  After installing the celery components using
    easy_install as stated at the top of the README, there's a bit more
    configuration you need to do to get celeryd (the celery daemon) 
    running when your server starts.

    **Note** The celery configuration points to the configured database,
    so the setup.py script must be run prior to performing these steps.
    
 1. Download the celery init.d script from github, put it into your 
    init.d folder, and enable it for startup
     
    > sudo wget --no-check-certificate -O /etc/init.d/celeryd \
        https://raw.github.com/celery/celery/v3.0.5/extra/generic-init.d/celeryd
    > sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/celeryd 
    > sudo update-rc.d celeryd defaults
   
 2. Copy the celeryd default settings file to your /etc/default directory. It
    contains information such as the location of the log files and the user 
    account under which celery runs

    > sudo cp /projects/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder/docs/celeryd /etc/default

 3. Create your log- and pid-file directories so that www-data can read and 
    write them.

    > sudo mkdir /var/log/celery /var/run/celery
    > sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/celery /var/run/celery/

 4. Celery should be ready to go, start it from the init script.

    > sudo service celeryd start

== Data Configuration ==
    Depending on your data, you may want to use the admin interface in 
    the application to edit the display names of your subjects and add
    reasonable "targets" so that the districts are properly displayed.
    
    You can also use the admin interface to determine which subjects
    will be displayed as viewable on the map.  If you make a subject
    visible on the map, be sure to set the target value so that styling
    can be applied to the district values.
    
    You can reach the admin interface by going to:
    
    https://<yourServerName>/admin
    

== E-mail ==
    If you'd like to allow users to retrieve forgotten passwords, make 
    sure you set the Mailer options. These settings can be found in the 
    config.xml file to reflect the server and authentication settings 
    for your mail server. 

== Documentation ==
    The class documentation is available on any instance at 
    https://<yourServerName>/docs/. Documentation is generated by epydoc.
    If you make any changes to the documentation or code, you can use the 
    epydoc.config file to regenerate the documentation in the docs/html 
    folder.

    The database schema image (schema.png) was generated using postgresql 
    autodoc and graphviz.
